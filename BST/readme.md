Binary Search Tree is a special type of binary tree that has a specific order of elements in it.

BST property:

- All nodes in the left subtree of a node should have a value lesser than the node’s value.
- All nodes in the right subtree of a node should have a value greater than the node’s value
- Both the left and right subtrees should be binary search trees too.
